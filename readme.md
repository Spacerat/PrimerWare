PrimerWare
==========

Primerware is basically like a two player WarioWare DS game, written for two STM32 Primer2s connected by a serial cable or infared. The graphics are just circles and squares and text, there is no sound and there are only three minigames.

The mini games have singleplayer and multiplayer (co-operative) modes. A VS mode was planned but not implimented.
